%
\usepackage{cite}
\usepackage{array}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}

%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:

% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with

% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig



% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Positioning systems based on GPS have become ubiquitous over the past few decades. Due to the attenuation of GPS signals, they cannot be used in an indoor setting for localization. In recent years, multiple attempts have been made to design a localization system for indoor applications. Indoor localization has the potential for trans-formative impact in a wide variety of applications like augmented reality, indoor navigation, asset tracking and advertising. Due to the inherent nature of the applications, high accuracy as well as energy efficiency is required.
Based on the target application, various methods and system architectures have been proposed using broadcast-based technologies(RFID\cite{bouet2008rfid}, BLE\cite{alps}, WiFi\cite{yang2012locating}, Ultrasound\cite{ultrasonic}) and motion based algorithms(Inertial based sensing)\cite{li2012reliable}.   

In our work, we develop a system for Indoor Localization to track mobile TAG nodes in an indoor setting with multiple anchor nodes whose coordinates are known. We use Decawave's DWM1000 modules to perform accurate ranging and Arduino UNO WiFi modules to control the modules and perform basic computation. We achieve a best case and average accuracy of 10cm and 20 cm across each axes.

\section{Introduction}

\cite{bouet2008rfid} surveys various RFID based localization strategies. RFID based localization schemes suffer from need for several active RFID anchors to be able to localize accurately. WiFi based localization require intensive calibration in the area of localization. Several methods have been proposed to crowdsource the RSSI values from different WiFi access points \cite{yang2012locating}. Another approach to this problem has been to use two different mediums and measure the time difference of arrival of signals in both the mediums. This is the approach used by \cite{alps} wherein the different speed of travel of bluetooth and ultrsonic waves are used to estimate distance. Inertial based localization strategies \cite{li2012reliable} fail to achieve sub metre accuracy due to drift from initial calibration that compounds with time. A recent development in the indoor localization domain has been the success of UWB based methods\cite{uwb}. The promise of UWB based localization was witnessed by DWM1000, a UWB localization chip winning the Microsoft indoor localization competition in the year 2015.

\section{Architecture}
This section describes the overall system architecture as well as some of the design decisions we took during the course of this project.  We begin by describing the different localization algorithms.  Next, we describe the software architecture and finally describe the hardware design choices.   
\subsection{Localization Algorithm}
There are two predominant methods used in the field of localization (both indoor and outdoor).  The first is time-of-flight measurement. This computes the point-to-point distance between two nodes based on the round trip time of a time-stamped packet travelling in a known medium. Alternatively, time-difference-of-arrival uses the difference in time of arrival between multiple packets sent from different time-synchronized anchor nodes at the same time.

\subsubsection{Time of Flight}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:tof}, the time-of-flight (TOF) method computes the distance between the two nodes by measuring the round-trip time of a time stamped packet.  As given by equations \ref{eq:tof} and \ref{eq:distcalc} node 1 sends the packet (t1 at t1\textsubscript{tx})  and waits for node 2 to respond (t2 at t2\textsubscript{rx}).  Upon receiving the packet, node 2 responds with another packet, which contains the time difference between when node 2 receives the first packet and sends the response.  When node 1 receives node 2's response, it calculates the difference between when it sent the first packet and when it receives the response.  Node 2's response latency, which is embedded in the response packet is then subtracted from this time to obtain the true round trip time.  The packet travels twice the distance between the nodes, so the distance between the two nodes is equal to half the round trip time multiplied by the speed of the packet in the given medium, as given by \ref{eq:distcalc}.  In case of the DWM1000, the speed of the packet is the speed of light in air and in case of ultrasonic methods, this is the speed of sound in air and so on.  In 3D space, the distance computed between an anchor and a tag defines a sphere where the tag must lie.  The tag must then periodically find its distance from four different anchor nodes placed around the room.  The 3D location of the tag will then be the intersection of the four spherical surfaces generated in this process.  The advantage of the TOF method is that it does not require time synchronization between the nodes, but only requires a precise clock at the source node.  However, since the round trip time is measured, this method requires the delay added due to transducers (RF circuits in our case) and the response time of node 2 to be modelled accurately.  In the case of the DWM1000 modules, these parameters are factory calibrated and don't cause any accuracy issues.  


\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{tof.png}
\caption{{Illustration of Time of Flight algorithm}}
\label{fig:tof}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:tof}
    T = (t2_{rx} - t1_{tx}) - (t2_{tx} - t1_{rx})
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:distcalc}
    Distance = \frac{Speed\ of\ Light \times T}{2}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Time Difference of Arrival}
The time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) method is shown in <Figure>.  In this method, the target tag periodically sends beacons to anchors in its vicinity.  When the anchors have time synchronized clocks, the time difference of arrival of the packet at between each pair of anchor nodes defines a hyperbolic surface on which the target tag must lie.  The tag's 3D location can be computed by finding the intersection of all these hyperbolic surfaces.  This method does not require the response time of the anchors to be modelled and is less sensitive to transducer delay (since it computes the difference anyway).  However, it does require very precise time synchronization between the clocks of every anchor in the network.  Specifically for the DWM1000, the medium is an electromagnetic wave, so any error in time synchronization gets multiplied by the speed of light. 

\subsection{System Architecture}
In our project, we propose and implement a system which is both accurate enough and energy efficient to be powered by batteries. The proposed method uses Time of Flight(TOF) algorithm to calculate the distance between two nodes. Although, TOF requires high time-synchronization and accurate time-stamping, we expect to achieve good results with this approach using the Decawave DW1000 sensors. The manufacturer claims a distance measurement accuracy within 10cm using these sensors.  The block diagram of Arduino Uno Wifi and DW1000 are shown in figures \ref{arduinoBD} and \ref{DW1000BD}.

We can localize any node if we know the distance of the node from 3 or more fixed anchor points. In the TOF approach, every node that we are trying to localize, transmits packets to a set of anchored nodes whose locations are known. The anchor nodes reply with the appropriate timestamps. Using the roundtrip time taken, the distance between pairs of nodes can be calculated. Once the distance of the mobile node from each of the anchor nodes is determined, the co-ordinates of the mobile nodes can be multilaterated in 3 dimensions.
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{arduinounobd}
\caption{{Board layout of Arduino Uno Wifi SoC}}
\label{arduinoBD}
\end{figure}
To obtain the distance measurements, we chose to use time of flight of radio over UWB spectrum. UWB involves sending very short spikes of radio signals. This provides significant benefits like fine time resolution, energy efficiency and robustness to interference in harsh environments \cite{uwb}. UWB is also particularly resistant to Multi-Path effects. In this project we used the DecaWave ScenSor DWM1000 Modules for UWB TOF measurements. We had both our mobile and anchor nodes as DWM1000 modules. Using these modules the distance of the mobile node from each of the anchor nodes was determined.  This information was accumulated at a gateway for the multilateration computation. For this we interface DWM1000 with Arduino Uno Wifi using the SPI interface supported by DWM1000.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Software Design}

\subsubsection{Backend Software}
Python was chosen as the language for backend computation for the following reasons:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scipy and Numpy packages provides ready access to Minimization functions required for localization algorithm
    \item Matplotlib package provides an environment to scatter plot the tag location in 3D
    \item Python is a language best suited for prototyping. The tradeoff in speed was tolerable in this application as the point did not have to be plotted in realtime.
    \item Availability of Telnet library to connect to the Tag listening socket and read the distance values.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Decawave Library}
The Arduino DWM1000 library hosted by Thomas Trojer on github was used\cite{thotro:2017}. This library had the 2 way ranging code implemented with instructions on how to interface the DWM1000 with the Arduino. The library was still active as of writing this report.

\subsubsection{WiFi Library}
The standard library which ships with Aruduino Uno Wifi was used. It came with a reference program to relay the serial readings over Wifi. This library also makes the Arduino Uno a WiFi access point. The advantage of this compared to connecting to a public access point was the static IP allocation of the Tag node. Since the Tag was hosting the access point it always had the first IP in the subnet eliminating the need for having access to the public DHCP server.

\subsection{Hardware Design}
\subsubsection{Micro-controller Platform Decision}
When we initially started the project we had a set of specifications in mind for the microcontroller and wireless communication device.  We required a low power microcontroller board with low power WiFi connectivity.  The MCU should have at least one SPI and one UART port for interfacing with the Decawave and debugging in addition to whatever interface it requires for WiFi.  One solution was to use a low power MCU platform like Arduino or TI's MSP430/432 Launchpad and an external WiFi board like the Arduino WiFi sheild or the CC3100 BoosterPack.  However, we already had a Decawave board and a set of level shifter ICs and we did not want to add an additional board (and therefore another point of failure).  We then refined our requirement and looked for single board solutions that incorporated a WiFi radio along with a low power MCU.  While the Raspberry Pi is an obvious solution to this, we decided against it since the Raspberry Pi comes with a 1GHz ARM processor and high speed WiFi radio, both of which were an overkill for this application and had a power consumption that was definitely out of budget.  Finally, we narrowed down to the CC3200 Launchpad and the Arduino UNO WiFi.  We initially selected the CC3200 since it incorporates a single chip WiFi+MCU and we thought its power consumption would be lower, and the powerful 80MHz ARM Cortex M4 on the CC3200 might be needed for our algorithms.  However, upon carefully analyzing our options, we concluded in favor of the Arduino for the following reasons:\\

\textit{Library Support:}
The Decawave SPI driver and 1D ranging libraries were readily available for Arduino platforms and not directly available for the CC3200.  While the CC3200 does support the "Arduino-like" Energia platform, significant porting effort may have been needed just to get the CC3200 to talk to the Decawave.  The Arduino was preferable since the Arduino SPI libraries take care of the hardware abstractions and board-to-board dependencies.\\

\textit{On-chip Flash:}
The CC3200 also suffers from another drawback, which is the fact that it does not come with any on-chip flash.  While this is taken care of in the launchpad with the help of an external flash on the board, an MCU with on-chip flash benefits from easier programming and deployment.  We saw this as a major concern for the later stages of the the project where we would need to test and calibrate multiple of these boards and program them to make tweeks during testing time.  It is more convenient to have a device with built-in flash rather than requiring the additional step of using TI's UNIFLASH to program the external flash on the CC3200 board.\\

\textit{Power consumption:}
The CC3200 has an active power consumption of about 15.3mA at 3.3V without the WiFi radio on, which translates to an active power consumption of 50.49mW. When the WiFi radio is active at peak power, the total current consumption is 278mA at 3.3V, which is 917.4mW of peak active power excluding the power consumption of the external flash, which draws an additional standby current during runtime.
The ATMega328P consumes about 5.2mA at 5V when active, which translates to about 26mW active power consumption.  We needed to use 2 Arduinos in order to not stress the RAM on a single Arduino and obtain stable operation.  Therefore, the combined power consumption of both Arduinos is 52mW.  The Arduino responsible for WiFi transmission was an Arduino UNO WiFi with an ESP8266 WiFi Radio. The ESP8266 WiFi SoC on the Arduino UNO WiFi board has a peak power consumption of 170mA at 3.3V, and therefore has a peak power consumption of 561mW.  Therefore, our combined active power consumption for the 2 Atmel microcontrollers along with the ESP8266 is 613mW.  This makes the combined Arduino solution about 33\% more power efficient than the CC3200 solution, even without considering the CC3200's external flash's standby current. \\

The main reason for choosing the CC3200 initially was that we were able to get a powerful MCU and a WiFi chip in a low cost, low power board.  However, we realized that it was more suitable to run the math-heavy least-squares linear equation solver needed for accurate localization on the backend software on a PC.  This gives us more flexibility to use the vast collection of mathematical libraries and filters available in NumPy while also reducing our MCU's CPU utilization.  Since we no longer needed such a powerful MCU, the Arduino's processing power and memory was sufficient for our purposes.  Based on the above reasons, we concluded that the Arduino UNO WiFi was the right device for the job.\\

\end{figure}

%One disadvantage of using ToF algorithm is that it cannot be scaled. As the number of nodes increase, we expect each node to consume more energy. As an extended goal, we propose to use Time Difference of Arrival(TDOA)\cite{anthonyrowe's paper} to provide scalability. In this system architecture, anchor nodes will broadcast their location to all the nodes that are being localized in the vicinity. Using the anchor node's location and the difference in time of arrival of packets from each of the anchor nodes, triangulation can be performed. A detailed explanation of these algorithms are provided in the next section.

\section{Implementation}
As shown in figure \ref{SYSTEMBD}, we use multiple anchor nodes with known positions to locate a mobile tag node. We use dynamic network discovery to connect tags with anchor nodes and perform 2-way ranging with each anchor node. The calculated distance between the tag and each anchor is sent from the tag to an admin laptop over WiFi. The distances from four anchor nodes is used to perform localization. The error of localization in our implementation is as less as 10 cm on each axis in the best case. On an average, we are able to locate the mobile node within a 20 cm error on all three axes. 
\subsection{Network Discovery and Communication}
A mobile tag node performs network discovery and initiates 2-way ranging with each of the anchor nodes. \textit{TAG} node controls the entire network to calculate the point-to-point distances between the anchor nodes and itself. As soon as the \textit{TAG} node is turned on, it broadcasts a \textbf{POLL} packet to all its neighbours. All the \textit{ANCHOR} nodes that receive the broadcast packet, respond with a \textbf{POLL\_ACK} message. The mobile node uses these acknowledgement messages to prepare a list of anchor nodes in its range. It is important to note that the mobile node sends one broadcast message and receives multiple acknowledgment messages.\\  
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{communication.png}
\caption{{Network discovery and two-way ranging protocol}}
\label{commsystem}
\end{figure}
Using the network discovery performed using \textbf{POLL} and \textbf{POLL\_ACK} messages, the mobile node maintains a list of anchor nodes and performs 2-way ranging with each of those nodes. Once the anchor nodes respond with \textbf{POLL\_ACK} message, it waits to receive the \textbf{RANGE\_INIT} packet from the mobile node. \textbf{RANGE\_INIT} and \textbf{RANGE} packets are exchanged between the nodes using timestamps to perform 2-way ranging. As shown in figure \ref{commsystem} the messages exchanged between the mobile node and the anchor nodes involve multiple steps and are performed one after the other. 

If an anchor node goes out of range after responding with the acknowledgement message, the mobile node marks it as an inactive node and deletes the corresponding anchor node from its network list. Thus, our communication protocol can discover dead anchor nodes immediately.

\subsection{Ranging Calibration}
Although the timestamps used by DWM1000 modules to perform 2-way ranging are quite accurate, there is an error in the point-to-point distance calculated due to the communication protocol overhead. Comparison between the actual distance and the calculated distance was made. It is observed that for small ranges, the percentage error in the distance measurement is quite high and this error reduces as the distance between two nodes increase. The error is calculated for distances from few centimeters to 10 meters and the plot is shown in figure \ref{abs_error} \& \ref{errorcalib}. 
\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{wsn_abs_error.png}
\caption{{Absolute error between 2 nodes while doing 2-way ranging}}
\label{abs_error}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{errorcalibfig.png}
\caption{{Percentage error between 2 nodes while doing 2-way ranging}}
\label{errorcalib}
\end{figure}

We use this data to calibrate the ranges sent from mobile node to the admin laptop. The point-to-point distance between the tag node and each anchor node is calibrated using a piecewise linear look-up table. Error calibration using this technique increased the localization accuracy significantly. The error calibration increased the accuracy from 50 cm on all three axes to 20 cm on an average. This only made our equation solver stable and converge sooner.




\subsection{Localization}

\begin{figure}[!h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{3D_localization.png}
\caption{{3-D Localization}}
\label{3dlocalization}
\end{figure}

The equations for localization were solved in Python using the Localization library\cite{kamalshadi:2017}. This library uses SciPy and NumPy libraries to find a least square error estimate of the three co-ordinates. The total error was defined as shown in Equations \ref{eq:error} and \ref{eq:dist}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dist}
D_i = \sqrt{(X-x_i)^2 + (Y-y_i)^2 + (Z-z_i)^2}
\end{equation}
where, $D_i$ is the distance of the tag from anchor $i$.\\
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:error}
 error = \sum\limits_{i} (D_i - r_i)^2 \forall\ anchor\ i
\end{equation}
where, $r_i$ is the range measured by DWM1000 to anchor $i$.\\

This error was minimized using $scipy.optimize.minimize$ with the initial estimate $X=0,Y=0,Z=0$.



\subsection{Placement of Anchor Nodes}

Different cofigurations of placement of anchor nodes was tried out. When all four anchor nodes were placed in one plane, the error in distances from each anchor gets compounded along the perperdicular dimension. Therefore the best possible placement was achieved by placing the 4 anchors as orthogonal as possible as shown in Figure: \ref{anchorplacement}. The lengths along each dimension were chosen for convenience of placing anchor nodes.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{anchorplacements3d.jpg}

\label{fig:tagnode}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Median Filtering}

To eliminate noise iin the samples, median filtering was performed on a sliding window. Median is particularly resilient to sparse errors. Hence the last 5 calculated co-ordinates were held in a queue. The present co-ordinate was chosen to be the median of these 5 values. This made our co-ordinates very robust.

\section{Challenges}
We faced a number of challenges during the course of this project.  These are listed below: 

\begin{itemize}
\item DWM1000 did not come with a base board to mount on a breadboard. This base board was ordered separately.
\item DWM1000 works on 3.3V while the Arduino Uno works on 5V. We had to procure level shifters to downshift the required SPI lines.
\item The library for 2-way ranging was not stable with more than 2 anchors. These were identified as arising due to race conditions in the library code. After considerable probing, we were able to narrow down the bug to the variable whose access was shared.
\item The distance measurements given by DWM1000 was initially off by about 1m. After plotting the actual distance vs the distance measured by DWM1000, it was evident that there is an offset between the two values. These offsets were recorded for each piecewise interval. A function was written which would convert the uncalliberated distance measured by DWM1000 to the actual distance by subtracting the corresponding offset.
\item The Arduino Uno board did not have enough RAM to run both the ranging code as well as the WiFi library. The workaround for this problem was to attach another Arduino to act as a WiFi slip radio to the tag. This Arduino would receive the ranging distance value over UART and transmit the data over WiFi.
\item The addition of another slave Arduino for WiFi relaying brought in additional constraints in keeping the Tag physically small and concise. We had to design custom legs for the breadboard to house both the Arduinos without bloating the Tag dimensions.
\end{itemize}
